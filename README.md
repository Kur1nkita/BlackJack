# BlackJack - WORK IN PROGRESS
A project in my spare time, and also my first project on github. This is a text-based blackjack game with also support for a local postgresql database to store all the data. 

PS. This will have European blackjack rules.

NB. 'pip install psycopg2' to use the sql commands

### Key features "Work in progress":
- Save previous board records, and the ability to display them.
- Database of players and their amount of money.
- Support for an unlimited amount of splits.
- The option to either use a sql database or a simple csv file, to store data.

### Maybe future features:
- Add insurance option.
- Low chance, but maybe plans for a graphic version of the game.
- Online? Maybe.
