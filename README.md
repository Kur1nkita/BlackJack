# BlackJack
A project on my spare time, and also my first project on github. This is a text-based blackjack game with also support for a local postgresql database to store all the data. 

PS. This will have European blackjack rules.

Key features "Work in progress":
- Save previous board records, and display them.
- Database of players and their amount of money.
- Support for unlimited amount of splits.
